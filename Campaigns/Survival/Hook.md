**Survival**

~~The Eagles are coming!~~ No. They aren't. You're on your own.

_What was once a prospering country now lies in ruins. It was perfectly normal. And then the grass started to turn brown, then the trees started to rot. Birds fell from the sky. The soil itself dried out, turning to sand in some places. People were weakened, collapsing on the streets. Most did not survive - the weakest turned to dust on the spot. Not even bodies remained. When the survivors awoke, cities and towns were in ruins, buildings destroyed. What were once mighty rivers were reduced to trickling streams. Food was destroyed. People initially tried to share, but eventually fought in the streets over the few limited resources, most of them dying in the process. The party was lost in the woods when this happened. It is currently near the end of fall. The temperatures at night are chilly, but not severely so._

# Scene 1 - Death of Ryla

```
From None to Three and then to One
From Twelve to None, it has begun
What has happened before
Will happen again, once more

As the Twins fall
With them goes all
Secrets to be revealed
They meet their end on the Battlefield

A sacrifice made in vain
A soul drowning in pain
A life lived without love
They rest in the stars Above

Nothing can stop the Nightmare
The world falling to disrepair
A world with no hope in the sky
Ending in a final goodbye
```

# Scene 2 - Sacrifice of Elpye

```
What has been done is done
I cannot stop what has begun
Hope begins to crumble away
From the edge it will decay

The weave of Time begins to fray
Without my thread, it will go astray
The Keepers have abandoned their post
I sacrifice myself for what matters most

A spell made of frost
Begins to truly become lost
A line of old has been torn down
By one who wears the true Crown

As my sight begins to fade
I begin to feel truly afraid
As my mind starts to Freeze
I look to those who have the Keys
```
