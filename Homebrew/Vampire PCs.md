# Traits

Shapechanger: If the vampire isn't in sun light or running water, it can use its bonus action to Polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form. While in bat form, the vampire can't speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its Statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

While in mist form, the vampire can't take any Actions, speak, or manipulate Objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 30 feet, can hover, and can enter a Hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution Saving Throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.

Charm (3/Day): The vampire Targets one Humanoid it can see within 45 ft. of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + the vampire's proficiency bonus + the vampire's Charisma modifier) against this magic or be Charmed by the vampire. The Charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's requests or Actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire's bite Attack.

Each time the vampire or the vampire's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a Bonus Action to end the effect.

# Attacks

Multiattack: The Vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite Attack.

Bite: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is Grappled by the Vampire, Incapacitated, or Restrained. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the Vampire regains Hit Points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a Long Rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

Claws: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (2d4 + 5) slashing damage. Instead of dealing damage, the Vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 13).
