### Shadow Casting

By harnessing the power of shadows, you are able to conjure magical effects

#### Cantrips

You know two cantrips of your choice from the shadow reaver spell list. You learn additional shadow reaver cantrips at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Shadow Reaver table

#### Preparing and Casting Spells

The Shadow Reaver table shows how many Shadow Points you have to cast your spells. To cast a spell, you must expend a number of Shadow Points as seen on the table below. You cannot reduce your Shadow Points below zero, nor can you cast a spell at a level higher than seen in the Shadow Level column. You regain all expended Shadow Points at the end of a long rest.

Spell Level | Point Cost
----------- | ----------
1           | 2
2           | 3
3           | 5
4           | 6
5           | 7
6           | 9
7           | 10
8           | 11
9           | 13

You prepare the list of Shadow Reaver spells that are available for you to cast. To do so chose a number of Shadow Reaver spells equal to your Charisma modifier + your shadow reaver level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level as seem in the Shadow Level column of the Shadow Reaver table.

For example, if you're a 3rd level Shadow Reaver with an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from the Shadow Reaver spell list. If you prepare <#TODO>, you can cast it as a 1st-level or 2nd-level spell, expending the appropriate amount of Shadow Points.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your shadow reaver spells. You use your Charisma when a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier whenever a spell refers to your DC for a shadow reaver spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

### Arcane Recovery

At 2nd level, over a short rest, you regain shadow points equal to your level. You may only use this feature once per long rest.

### Shadow Paths

When you reach 2nd level, you chose a shadow reaver path, shaping your usage of shadows. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1\. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Shadow Mastery

At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level shadow reaver spell and a 2nd-level shadow reaver spell. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending shadow points when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.

### Signature Shadows

When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level shadow reaver spells as your signature shadowss. You always have these spells prepared, they don't count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend shadow points as normal.

# Shadow Paths

## Lifegiver

Lifegivers try and create life from shadows and undeath. As you focus your shadows in this path, you learn to mimic the energy that animates all living things with your shadows. As you progress, you learn to sap the life force from a creature as your magic destroys its body, transforming that vital energy into magic power you can manipulate.

Most people see necromancers as menacing, or even villainous, due to the close association with death. Not all necromancers are evil, but the forces they manipulate are considered taboo by many societies.

### Grim Harvest

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to reap life energy from creatures you kill with your spells. Once per turn when you kill one or more creatures with a spell of 1st level or higher, you regain hit points equal to twice the spell's level, or three times its level if the spell belongs to the School of Necromancy. You don't gain this benefit for killing constructs or undead.

### Undead Thralls

At 6th level, you learn the Animate Dead spell. This spell is always prepared, and does not count against your number of prepared shadow reaver spells. When you cast Animate Dead, you can target one additional corpse or pile of bones, creating another zombie or skeleton, as appropriate.

Whenever you create an undead using a necromancy spell, it has additional benefits:

- The creature's hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your shadow reaver level.
- The creature adds your proficiency bonus to its weapon damage rolls.

### Inured to Undeath

Beginning at 10th level, you have resistance to necrotic damage, and your hit point maximum can't be reduced. You have spent so much time dealing with undead and the forces that animate them that you have become inured to some of their worst effects.

### Command Undead

Starting at 14th level, you can use magic to bring undead under your control, even those created by other shadow reavers. As an action, you can choose one undead that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your shadow reaver spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can't use this feature on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again.

Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.

## Shadow Sculpter

You focus your study on magic that mimics powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some shadow sculpters find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.

### Sculpt Spells

Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

### Potent Cantrip

Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip's damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.

### Empowered Shadows

Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1) to the damage roll of any shadow reaver evocation spell that you cast. The damage bonus applies to one damage roll of a spell, not multiple rolls.

### Overchannel

Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a shadow reaver spell of 5th level or lower that deals damage and isn't a cantrip, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.

The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12\. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.

# Example Shadow Reaver Spells

## Shadow Image

Illusion cantrip

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 30 feet

Components: S, M (a bit of fleece)

Duration: 1 minute

You mimic a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.

If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.

If you create an image of an object--such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest--it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.

If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

## Dark Geyser

1st-level Evocation

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Self (15-foot cube)

Components: V, S Duration: Instantaneous

A wave of dark nergy sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 necrotic damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.

In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell's effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

## Consume Shadows

1st-level Evocation

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Components: V, S

Duration: Instantaneous

A creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier as you call upon shadows to fill their wounds. This spell has no effect on constructs.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

## Shadowball

2nd Level Evocation

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 60 feet

Components: V S M (A chip of mica)

Duration: Instantaneous

You hurl a ball of shadows at point of your choice within range, which explodes in a loud burst of dark energy and sound. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw. A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

## Shadow Step

2nd Level Conjuration

Casting Time: 1 bonus action

Range: Self

Components: V

Duration: Instantaneous

Travelling through nearby shadows, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.

## Vampiric Touch

3rd level Necro... Just google this one.
