# Broken Mirror (Requires Attunement) (Sentient)

This item automatically attunes to whoever it owns, breaking its attunement to its previous owner. While you remain attuned to the mirror, you are unwilling to part with it, keeping it within reach at all times. Once per day, at the worst possible moment, a roll you make is replaced with a Natural 1.

# Deck of Many (Unfortunate) Things

Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number cause the spell "Animate Objects" to be cast on the deck, targeting the user. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once. Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.

Your character's personality swaps (introvert => extrovert, shy => bard, etc).

3  | Donjon    | You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an dimensional Sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the Sphere. You can't be located by any Divination magic, but a wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.
4  | Euryale   | The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty on Saving Throws while Cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.
5  | The Fates | You may cast Wish, originating from yourself, once. You must do this immediately.

14 | Rogue     | A non-player character of the DM's choice becomes Hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a wish spell or Divine Intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.
15 | Ruin      | All forms of Wealth that you carry or own, other than Magic Items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.
16 | Skull     | You summon an avatar of death-a ghostly Humanoid Skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the DM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 Hit Points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own Avatar of Death.

In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of Monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.
21 | Vizier    | At any time you choose within one week of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with Wisdom on how to apply it.
22 | The Void  | This black card Spells Disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is Incapacitated. A wish spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.

# Pendant of the Dead (Attunement Required) (Cursed)

At a glance, this appears to be a simple +2 AC Pendant. Every few days at Dawn, the pendant will offer the user an upgrade in exchange for certain tasks. While you remain attuned to the pendant, you are unwilling to part with it, keeping it within reach at all times.

1. In exchange for minor worship of its dark deity, such as saying a few cryptic lines before bedtime, the pendant grants an ASI to the user (similar to leveling up).
2. The weapon asks for slightly more worship, such as the occasional burnt offering. In exchange, the pendant offers an additional +1 AC.
3. For an occasional animal sacrifice, such as a squirrel, rabbit, or small bird, the pendant offers the ability to use one of your hit die as a reaction during combat.
4. If you swear to kill any Celestial or Undead you see (you are not required to actively hunt them), the pendant offers a +3 to all attack rolls.
5. If you actively hunt Celestials or Undead, the pendant offers the ability of increased luck.
6. If you agree to sacrifice Celestial and Undead to the dark deity, the pendant offers blessings in battle.
7. If you take the dark deity as a patron/deity, the pendant offers the promise of power, but is not more specific.
8. The pendant asks you to devote yourself to the deity in full, and you would gain its full power. If you take Upgrade 8, you are now an NPC.

# Necklace of Fate (Requires Attunement)

This adamantine necklace is normally barely visible - only able to be seen by someone who knows what to look for. The wearer of this artifact may opt to borrow luck from the distant future to take effect in the present.

This necklace possesses one charge, which it regains each day at dawn. When a creature within 300 feet of you makes an attack roll, ability check, saving throw, or rolls for damage, you may use your reaction to force the roll(s), at your discretion, to the minimum, maximum, or average value possible.

The DM may chose to collect on the borrowed luck (optionally with interest) at any time.

# Mithril Dagger (Requires Attunement)

You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, any attack made with this dagger while attuned has advantange and counts as a critical hit on a 19\. The dagger is also self-cleaning, and any blood that coats it fades within seconds.

This dagger used to belong to a powerful being before it was stolen. Every day at Midnight, the being attempts to Scry the wielder. In addition, blood siphoned from this dagger is used to summon various fiends by the original owner in an attempt to reclaim the dagger.

# Adamantine Ring

When this ring is exposed to blood, it instantaneously expands into a set of +2 Adamantine Plate Armor for the next hour.

This ring acts as a beacon into the Ethereal and Astral planes, drawing all sorts of things to it, ranging from aberrations to deities.

# World Crystal

Each face of this gem acts as a portal to a different plane. As an action, a creature can locate a specific face and instantaneously jump to the plane it represents, bringing the crystal and up to 8 willing targets within 30 feet of them with. The crystal always jumps the target to the most significant location on the target plane.

When a character uses this gem, roll a d20\. On a 1, the gem shatters, expelling shrapnel in a 60 foot radius sphere. Any creature within must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature is warped to an inhospitable and unsettled location on a random plane.

# Arcane Printer

Over a minute, this printer can apply a +2 enchant to any nonmagical item, which is removed when the item comes into contact with water. Doing so requires one vial of Mystic Toner, which is traditionally made from ground-up dragon scales, which is fused onto the item with heat and a high-power laser.

Occasionally, the players will be sold gunpowder instead of toner.

# Wildcard (Requires Attunement)

A silver ring with a four-coloured gemstone in the center, which occasionally sparkles with magic.

When the attuned person dies, time rewinds to the moment they first attuned to the wildcard. The color then fades from the ring. As an action, by bringing the ring into contact with a single drop of blood from the target, the wielder may cause them to remember the undone events. This process is time-consuming, though, and the target falls into a coma as they process the events. This coma may be lifted with a Greater Restoration or more powerful spell.

Any other Wildcard wielders remember the actions of the future. In addition, any divination magic cast by the user will now draw from the erased timeline, thus occasionally giving false information.
