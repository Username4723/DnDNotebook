# Fish

This fish will never go bad.

This item automatically attunes to whoever steals it, breaking its attunement to its previous owner. While you remain attuned to the fish, you are unwilling to part with it or consume it, keeping it within reach at all times. Anybody attempting to steal the fish from you has advantage.

# Werewolf Blood

As an action, you may coat one weapon with this blood. The next attack you make with this weapon will force the target to make a DC 15 Constitution check to avoid contracting Lycanthropy. A creature that ingests the blood automatically fails.

# Scroll of Scarring

A magical scroll containing the most vile and profane knowledge, such as the secret indulgences of gods, pictures of friends and family in awkward situations, all three episodes of Boku no Pico, or Sarah's search history. Anybody reading this scroll must make a DC 20 Wisdom save or take 4d12+20 psychic damage, or half on a success. The damage is healed in 1d4+2 rounds. The reader gains the Haunted One background.

# Blindfold of Greater Invisibility (Requires Attunement)

Exactly what it says on the tin.

# Invisible Paint

Looks exactly like water but comes in a paint bottle.

As an action, you can use the paint to turn yourself invisible for one minute. Alternatively, you may throw the paint on an enemy's clothes as an action, forcing them to make a Dexterity saving throw or be Frightened and Incapacitated as they cower in embarrassment.
