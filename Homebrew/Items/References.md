# Red Yo-Yo (Requires Attunement)

This red yoyo with black spots has a limitless amount of string, which never tangles and can be rewound instantly.

As an action, this yoyo can, within a range of 120ft, be used to block entrances, move objects, or bind people (DC 20 to escape). In addition, Touch spells can be cast through the yoyo, up to a range of 100ft.

# Metal Rod

This rod is about a foot long and has green lines across it, along with a cluster of buttons.

This magical weapon grants a +3 to a attack and damage rolls, dealing 3d12 damage. In addition, by pressing one of the buttons, as a bonus action, the length and reach of the rod can be extended to a maximum of 300ft, though anything beyond 25ft is unusable for attacking.

# Copper Shortsword

Deals 1 damage. Upon exposure to blood under the light of the new moon, the sword temporarily absorbs nearby shadows, turning pitch black. For the next week, the damage changes to 2d6, and you have a +2 to attack and damage rolls made with this magical weapon.

# God Tuner (Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster)

This tuning fork is bound to the divine cosmos. While attuned to it, all Cleric and Paladin spells are considered spells of your class and on your class's spell list. Upon breaking attunement to this item, you forget all spells learned this way. It counts as an associated object for the purpose of Scrying a deity.
