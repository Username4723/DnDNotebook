# External

Note that for some things that tie in external lore, I'm not familiar with any of it - and I highly doubt it'd all fit within my campaign lore. Use with a grain of salt - We're not playing in a campaign world that has a mashup of (all canon) Harry Potter, Star Wars, Twilight, and whatever other lore comes from these sites.
