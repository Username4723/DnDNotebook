# Homebrew Compilation

This folder contains every bit of public homebrew ran by me for use in my campaigns, in addition to bits and pieces I've found while playing. Anything in the Rejected section is not allowed in campaigns where I am the DM due to reasons stated in the table. UA content is allowed by default, except for Modern Magic and Mystic. See below for conditions.

# Self-Written

Type  | Name          | Campaign Worlds Allowed
----- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Class | Shadow Reaver | All
Deity | Zokarin       | Dual Planes of Kilyn
Rules | Vampire PCs   | Dual Planes of Kilyn, Fallen Paradise, My Quiet Corner of the Universe

# External

Note that for some things that tie in external lore, I'm not familiar with any of it - and I highly doubt it'd all fit within my campaign lore. Use with a grain of salt - We're not playing in a campaign world that has a mashup of (all canon) Harry Potter, Star Wars, Twilight, and whatever other lore comes from these sites.
