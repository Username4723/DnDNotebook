# Deity: Zokarin
Patron God of Smiths, Artificers, Inventors, and Creators. Although he rarely works the Forge himself, it is said that his presence is capable of imbueing an item with magic and empower the creator. This is rare however, as he does not often intervene with the mortal world directly. He doesn't often require direct worship, as the act of forging itself is considered worship to him.

His more devoted followers, such as Clerics, Bards, and similar, are held to a stricter set of ideas, though. They are highly encouraged to have the right equipment for the job at hand, and are required to protect and give refuge to creators in need. They must try their best for works they personally create to be used and not simply admired, although for what purpose Zokarin doesn't specify.

However, Zokarin possesses little empathy for some. Those incapable of appreciating and using tools properly, such as ghosts and most undead, hold no respect in his mind - their lack of training and respect for what the few tools they can use is disgraceful. In addition, he is outright hostile to those who destroy, such as over-zealous armies. Those who have no respect for the quality of work also hold little weight in his mind - those who create and propagate weak or cheap gear to turn a profit, for instance. Because he believes things are created to be used, he is also very unappreciative of those who hoard the works of others - such as the hoards of dragons, some monarchs, or similar.
