# The Silent Assassin (Identity Unknown)

Little more than just a rumor, when a ruler dies out of the blue, talk inevitably spreads attributing it to the Silent Assassin. More times than not, after the death, dark secrets about the one assassinated are revealed. The Silent Assassin leaves no traces to the public, but to those the deceased engaged with, a single gold coin is always left under their pillow.

Written records of the Silent Assassin date back only a few hundred years.

# Archpriest of the Pantheons (Identity Known)

While individual churches and pantheons have their own hierarchies, when a major conflict arises between the two, it is the Archpriest that intervenes. Through this, they have earned the gratitude of several deities, of which they can invoke in times of need. In rare cases, the Archpriest has settled conflicts between the deities themselves when they are unable to do so.

The title of Archpriest is currently held by Cinedre Urovnu, a Drow living in Estella.

# The Icy Swordsman (Identity Unknown)

The Icy Swordsman stands on the peak of the furthest mountains, watching for a great evil. No matter what direction you travel, eventually you will encounter their mountain. A great blizzard always encircles the mountain, colder than the coldest snow. Very few have seen him, but those who do report that he carries no weapons save for a sword made entirely out of frost and snow. Allegedly, he can disarm even a master swordsman in a blink. A traveller who arrives at the right time once saw him in battle against an entity so cruel that words cannot describe it. The Icy Swordsman did nothing more than slash the air with his sword, and the snow in the air crystallized into knives, which swarmed the entity, killing it within minutes.

Reports of the Icy Swordsman date back hundreds of thousands of years. Incredibly gifted arcane magic users do not encounter the Swordsman, but instead a shimmering wall of force that they can pass through.

# Eryl, The Light Guardian (Identity Unknown)

The Light Guardian seeks not to protect good itself, but to destroy evil. Unlike other evil-destroyers, Eryl tends not to destroy individual sources of evil, but instead eradicate it at the source. When he cannot destroy the source, he often targets anywhere the source has influenced. He's won fame through their destruction of the Werewolf Lord Wymond.

Eryl tends to keep his identity secret through obscurity, not hiding. When traveling, he is seen wearing a pure white cloak, though he doesn't try and hide their face, and nobody has figured out his true identity. All attempts to interact with him physically result in Eryl phasing through people. Sightings of Eryl date back thousands of years.

# Aire, Spirit of Spring (Identity Unknown)

Aire is one of the few spirits that roam the material realm freely. They do not have a favored form, and to most observers, they appear resembling a close loved one. They posses incredible healing magic, capable of bringing back those even the mightiest archpriests cannot.

# Keya, Queen of Light (Identity Known) (Deceased)

Once a sorcerer of great sorcerer, Keya fought for good wherever she could. From defending lands from evil sorcerers or liberating kingdoms from Dark Lords, she was renowned wherever she went. The people of one of the lands she freed from tyranny appointed her as royalty, as theirs was mercilessly butchered. Eventually, in her later days, her lands were threatened by an unknown evil attacking the capital during the middle of the night - some rumors say it was a rogue genie, others say a price of darkness, and others more say it was a spirit from beyond. People were dying in the streets, including her own family. Regardless, she went off to fight one last time. She did not return, but neither did the evil.

# Zera, Warden of Darkness (Identity Unknown)

How do you constrain the most powerful casters, the sneakiest rogues, or the undying? You hand them over to Zera. Keeper of an immense prison, she has the ability to constrain all but the most powerful. Few among the most powerful know how to contact her - those turned over to her are almost never seen again. Prison breaks are rare - such events are normally the stuff of legend. When a prison break _does_ occur, even the most hostile of countries put aside their differences, albeit temporarily, to recapture the escaped.

# Mythryne, Smith of the Cosmos (Identity Known)

Archpriest of Zokarin, Mythryne can create items of legends. It is not uncommon for legendary adventurers to posses at least one item made by her or her predecessors, or quest to recover one. Rarely, parties will try and approach her to commission gear, and while her prices are no higher than regular items, the path to her forge is wrought with danger.

The Smith of the Cosmos is a title always belonging to the Archpriest, and its existence date to over hundreds of thousands of years ago. The current forge is located inside a volcano in Etren.

# Elpye, Chronomancer Supreme (Identity Unknown)

Elpye is a mysterious figure. Watching from atop a crystal mountain where she can see the world in full, they have the ability to rewind time for the material world. Very few accounts of this have survived, but at most Elpye has been said to be able to rewind up to a minute, and even then there are sometimes forces that oppose her. She does not rewind time lightly, and at most once per millennium (though not many records of her interference survive).

Her motives are unclear, but anyone who scales her crystal mountain can learn some of her knowledge of the world. Accounts of her have existed since the start of written history.

# Victory, Queen of the Assassins (Identity Unknown)

One of the most secretive assassins, she has never failed. Meeting only through her agents and through the most secretive of places, not a single person has seen her true form.

Her reign has lasted at least a dozen years and spans the material realm.

# Ryl, Dragon of Magma (Identity Known)

Lord of Red Dragons, Ryl possesses the ability to create land at will, from islands to continents. It is rumored that once an ancient civilization antagonized him, and he buried the island civilization in magma so hot it burned away any trace of their existence. Normally, he sleeps on the ocean floor where his breath alone creates extreme volcanoes and volatile weather.

# Lyn, Spirit of the Sea (Identity Known)

Another of the few spirits the Icy Swordsman allows into the material realm, Lyn is a wandering sea spirit. The rare times that she's lured onto land, the water tends to follow, leading to floods, hurricanes, and tsunamis. For this reason, she prefers to stay by the shore whenever possible. Her extended presence has led to the sinking of islands and flooding of continents.
